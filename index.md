## Biography
<img id="bio-portrait" src="/assets/img/me2.jpg">

Hi all - my name is Bryson Lee, and I'm a software engineer and technical director in Computer Graphics (CG) production systems and artist workflow tools for 3D animation, visual effects, and video games. I'm currently an Associate Research and Development Engineer at [Blizzard Entertainment](http://www.blizzard.com) in the Animation and Cinematics divison, where I'm helping design new software, systems, and tools for the next generation of the studio pipeline. I graduated from Santa Clara University in 2018 with a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering.

Before Blizzard, I had rare opportunities to intern at other amazing CG studios, including [Industrial Light and Magic](http://www.ilm.com/), [Walt Disney Animation Studios](https://www.disneyanimation.com/), and [Disney Interactive](https://dcpi.disney.com/). A large majority of my work involved projects to incoperate advanced forms of assets in distributed workflows.

Creative technology and computer graphics is my primary professional interest. As a contributor to the [ACM SIGGRAPH](https://www.siggraph.org/) community, I was the founding president of Santa Clara University's SIGGRAPH Student Chapter, a chartered ACM chapter that ran educational workshops for topics in computer graphics and interactive media. I routinely return to Santa Clara and visit other Silicon Valley schools to run career workshops for students interested in the CG industry.

In my free time, you can usually find me composing music, playing piano, or [destroying my opponents as a D.Va main](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.Va). I also do a bit of [storywriting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiction_writing) - feel free to check out my [blog](http://brysonlee.com/blog). The bird in the masthead of my website is the [Nene goose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nene_(bird)), the state bird of my hometown of Hawaii.

    <p>At ILM, I worked primarily with ILM's in-hosue render farm system, asset management infrastructure, media creation pipeline, and multisite data transfer services. I collaborated closely with Walt Disney Animation Studios during this period to implement <i>Coda</i> and <i>dpix</i>, two technologies for render queuing and media/review cataloging, respectively. I created core API services for data transfer between studio clients stretched at a global scale, and enabled support for remote VFX Supervisor platforms. I also collaborated to production staff to apply a new artist facing pipeline for Motion Capture work flows.</p>

    <p>As part of the Media Technology Engineering divison, I designed and built new software to support Disney's growing asset management infrastructure and spearheaded multiple initiatives to revamp an existing creative content pipeline for web publishing. I also created administrative tools for digital asset management, including video/image media and file metadata (Metrics, statistical analysis, and database management). A major intiative was to improve scalability of DI's in-house asset management system through design and implementaiton database super tools which managed, reindexed, and mapped collection of assets for Disney's creative content and publishing workflow.</p>
