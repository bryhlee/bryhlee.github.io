Hi - my name is Bryson Lee, and I'm a technical director (TD) and engineer in Computer Graphics (CG) production systems for 3D animation, visual effects, and video games. I'm currently a Software Engineer at [Blizzard Entertainment](http://www.blizzard.com) in the Animation and Cinematics divison of the Story and Franchise Development Department. I graduated from Santa Clara University in 2018 with a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering. While I broadly categorize my skill set as "pipeline focused", I primarily specialize in story, editorial, and concepting workflows, asset management systems, post production technology, and media review pipelines.

Before Blizzard, I interned for other studios including [Industrial Light and Magic](http://www.ilm.com/), where I collaborated with [Walt Disney Animation Studios](https://www.disneyanimation.com/), and [Disney Interactive](https://dcpi.disney.com/), a media and entertainment production company. A majority of my projects involved the incorperation of advanced assets into distributed workflows.

While creative technology and computer graphics is my academic and professional concentration, I'm also involved in several other [projects](https://www.brysonlee.com/projects) that cover a wide variety of creative disciplines, including producing and directing animated content. I occasionally visit schools to run career workshops for students interested in the CG industry.

In my free time, you can usually find me [writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiction_writing) or [destroying my opponents as a D.Va main](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.Va). I also do a fair bit of [blogging](https://www.brysonlee.com/blog) about a bunch of random stuff. <!-- The bird in the masthead of my website is the [Nene goose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nene_(bird)), the state bird of my hometown of Hawaii. -->
