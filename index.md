## Biography
<img id="bio-portrait" src="/assets/img/me2.jpg">

Hi all - my name is Bryson Lee, and I'm a software engineer and technical director in Computer Graphics (CG) production systems and artist workflow tools for 3D animation, visual effects, and video games. I'm currently an Associate Research and Development Engineer at [Blizzard Entertainment](http://www.blizzard.com) in the Animation and Cinematics divison, where I'm helping to build the next generation of the studio's pipeline and further improve existing software, systems, and tools. I graduated from Santa Clara University in 2018 with a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering and am currently pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science at USC with a concentration in Creative Technology and Multimedia Systems.

During the summer of 2017, I worked as a Production Engineering Intern at [Industrial Light and Magic](http://www.ilm.com/). While there, I collaborated with [Walt Disney Animation Studios](https://www.disneyanimation.com/) to develop new rendering queuing systems, rebuild global studio tools, and improve core elements of ILM's media creation pipeline. Together with motion capture TDs and VFX supervisors, I facilitated projects to incorporate new and advanced forms of assets in a distributed artist workflow.

Prior to ILM, I was a Software Engineering Intern at [Disney Interactive](https://dcpi.disney.com/). As part of the Media Technology Engineering divison, I designed and built new software to support Disney's growing asset management infrastructure and spearheaded multiple initiatives to revamp an existing creative content pipeline for web publishing.

Creative technology and computer graphics is my academic specialization and my primary professional interest. As a contributor to the [ACM SIGGRAPH](https://www.siggraph.org/) community, I was the founding president of Santa Clara University's SIGGRAPH Student Chapter, a chartered ACM chapter that ran educational workshops for topics in computer graphics and interactive media.

Besides creative technology and CG, my other technical interests include interactive media, video transcoding, media streaming tools, scalable UI frameworks (both web and desktop paradigms), high performance computing, and 3D/2D animation software.

In my free time, you can usually find me composing music, playing piano, or [destroying my opponents as a D.Va main](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.Va). I also do a bit of [storywriting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiction_writing) - feel free to check out my [blog](http://brysonlee.com/blog).
