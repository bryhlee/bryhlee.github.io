Hey there! All of this is eventually going to be rewritten! Ignore the other nonsense!

My name is Bryson Lee, and thank you for visiting my personal webpage. Feel free to explore this site and my blog to learn more about me, my expertise, and some [projects](/projects/) I am working on.

Where do I begin? Well, first off, I'm a software engineer based out of the San Francisco Bay Area. For the past three years, I have been working in production engineering and technical development for film, 3D animation, and visual effects pipelines. I'm also an amateur composer and pianist, my favorite philosopher is Nietzsche, and I'm an avid [vexillologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vexillology) (perhaps my nerdiest obsession).

Currently, I am student at Santa Clara University working towards a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering. I always find myself busy, building new projects with friends or with the various companies I have interned at. Most recently, I worked as a Software Engineering Intern on the Media Technology Engineering team at Disney Interactive. Alongside my professional work, I have a history of academic research with Santa Clara University's Frugal Innovation Lab, where in 2015, I co-wrote a paper on effective mobile Health frameworks for use in third world countries. I am a long-time contributer to the ACM SIGGRAPH community: I served as a Student Volunteer (SV) at SIGGRAPH 2016, and I am the current President and Founder of Santa Clara University's SIGGRAPH Student Chapter, a student organization that promotes and runs workshops to teach students topics in computer graphics and interactive media.

I will be interning at Industrial Light and Magic (ILM/Lucasfilm) as a Production Engineer for the Summer of 2017. To learn more about my experience and qualifications, please feel free to view or download my resume using the button below.
