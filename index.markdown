Hi - my name is Bryson Lee, and I'm a technical artist with a focus on art tools, pipelines, visual development, world building, environment art, graphics, and shaders. I graduated from Santa Clara University in 2018 with a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering and a concentration in multimedia computing.

As a Technical Artist at [Blizzard Entertainment](https://www.blizzard.com){:target="_blank"} in the Blizzard Animation group, I collaborate with artists and engineers to streamline workflows and create tooling to support the artistic vision of Blizzard's IPs. Some recent work include the in-game cinematics for [Diablo 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HukrLKMCz1I&ab_channel=Diablo){:target="_blank"} and [World of Warcraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwEE85vd42c&ab_channel=WorldofWarcraft){:target="_blank"}.

I have a background in Computer Graphics systems for 3D animation and visual effects. Before rejoining Blizzard in 2022, I  worked as a Software Engineer at [Pixar Animation Studios](https://www.pixar.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Industrial Light and Magic](https://www.ilm.com/){:target="_blank"}, and [Disney Interactive](https://dcpi.disney.com/){:target="_blank"}. My responsibilities included asset systems, advanced assets, distributed pipelines, review workflows, and comprehensive artist support.

My professional interests include stylized art workflows, procedural environment generation, world building pipelines, practical deformers, dynamic shaders, efficient asset creation, performance, and simulations. I also do a fair bit of gameplay programming. Feel free to check out [my profolio](https://www.brysonlee.com/projects).

In my free time, you can usually find me [writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_fantasy){:target="_blank"} or climbing the competitive ladder in [Overwatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.Va){:target="_blank"}. I occasionally visit schools to run career workshops for students interested in the video game industry. I regularly update my [blog](https://www.brysonlee.com/blog) with a bunch of random stuff.
