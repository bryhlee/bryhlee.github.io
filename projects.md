# Technical Projects

<h3>Pipeworks Project<span class="badge">In Progress</span></h3>
A cloud-based suite of software that will enable small to medium sized teams to set up a possibly globally-distributed art pipeline to run efficient CG productions remotely. *Pipeworks* provides a comprehensive, out-of-the-box, yet modular set of tools to streamline CG content creation. The Pipeworks project is comprised of five core components: The *Pipeworks Cloud Repository* (PCR), the *Pipeworks SDK* (PSDK), the *Pipeworks Application Interface* (PAI), the *Pipeworks Tool Suite (PTS)*, and a new UI [design language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_language), *Spout UI*. Most -- if not all -- of Pipeworks was implemented using Python with a combination of various 3rd party frameworks. You can view it [here](https://github.com/bryhlee/pipeworks).

<h3>Matterhorn Digital Asset Manager</h3>
Image, video, and file manager for digital art assets including support for most image and video formats. Built multiple administrative tools and interfaces for video transcoding, metrics and diagnostics, meta data tracking, legacy tracking, and indexing helper tools. *Matterhorn* was built using NodeJS, Javascript, Python, Flask, and Google App Engine together with the Google Cloud Platform.

<h3>vcontrol: A Lightweight CG Version Control System</h3>
Increasingly in recent years, digital artists have been using [version control systems (VCS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) originally meant for software developers to manage complex non-text/binary files. In light of this trend, *vcontrol* was developed as a CLI VCS that supports a simplified and lightweight platform allowing artists to stage local versions of art assets before committing  them for review in an existing pipeline. vcontrol was built entirely using Python and packaged using PyInstaller. It supports common VCS commands including commiting, reverting, and branching for distributed version control and remote workflow support. The source code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/bryhlee/vcontrol).
