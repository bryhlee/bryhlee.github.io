    <h3 class="project-title">Pipeworks Project<span class="badge">In Progress</span></h3>
    <p>A cloud-based suite of software that will enable small to medium sized teams to set up a possibly globally-distributed art pipeline to run efficient CG productions remotely. <i>Pipeworks</i> provides a comprehensive, out-of-the-box, yet modular set of tools to streamline CG content creation. The Pipeworks project is comprised of five core components: The <i>Pipeworks Cloud Repository</i> (PCR), the <i>Pipeworks SDK</i> (PSDK), the <i>Pipeworks Application Interface</i> (PAI), the <i>Pipeworks Tool Suite</i> (PTS), and a new UI <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_language">design language</a>, <i>Spout UI</i>.</p>

    <h3 class="project-title">vcontrol: A Lightweight Version Control System</h3>
    <p>Increasingly in recent years, digital artists have been using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">version control systems (VCS)</a> originally meant for software developers to manage complex non-text/binary files. In light of this trend, <i>vcontrol</i> was developed as a CLI VCS that supports a simplified and lightweight platform allowing artists to stage local versions of art assets before committing  them for review in an existing pipeline. vcontrol was built entirely using Python and packaged using PyInstaller. It supports common VCS commands including commiting, reverting, and branching for distributed version control and remote workflow support.</p>

    <h3 class="project-title">Life Manager<span class="badge">In Progress</span></h3>
    <p>A desktop and mobile tool that links to a cloud-based system to manage important dates, set reminders, schedule recurring payments, and plan personal projects. Life Manager is inspired by ticket-based project management strategies and allows you to track, manage, and sort your work efficiently. While most applications sacrifice control and flexibility to accomodate for intuitive interfaces, Life Manager recognizes the importance in creating powerful software with depth and appropriate complexity for the task. Coincidentally, the task of managing tasks is something that can become swift and efficient given the right toolset. That's our philosophy, anyway.</p>
