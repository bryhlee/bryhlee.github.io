## Overview
My first experience programming was in middle school, where I created game mods for *Warcraft 3* using [JASS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JASS). Today, I build tools and systems for artists across the studio pipeline, helping bring to life the movies, games, and animations I grew up with. 

Jon Wynacht, my mentor at ILM, used to tell me that to become a better pipeline engineer, "If you're not breaking something, you're not learning - just don't do it too much." Since then, I always aim to achieve the same attitude of proactive development: one that emphasizes not being afraid to try something new and challenging in order to find the most rewarding solution.

Please feel free to browse around to learn more about my projects and their technical implementations.
