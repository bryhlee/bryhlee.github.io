Here, you will find a directory of projects that I am currently working on, or have worked on, in the past. These include many different technologies, ranging from full-stack web applications to smaller and more niche IT tools. Many of the projects I intiated myself, built around small and agile teams, while some are long term projects I personally managed alongside others at various companies. Please feel free to visit the links provided for each project to learn more.

Every project I work on aims to solve a particular problem, whether it involves creating a more effective digital infastructure, or improving an already existing concept. In general, there is one quote I live by when creating any piece of software solution:

Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.
Albert Einstein
