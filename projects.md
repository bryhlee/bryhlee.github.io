## Overview
My first experience programming was in middle school, where I created game mods for *Warcraft 3* using [JASS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JASS). Today, I build tools and systems for artists across the studio pipeline, helping bring to life the movies, games, and animations I grew up with. 

Jon Wynacht, my mentor at ILM, used to tell me that to become a better pipeline engineer, "If you're not breaking something, you're not learning - just don't do it too much." Since then, I always aim to achieve the same attitude of proactive development: one that emphasizes not being afraid to try something new and challenging in order to find the most rewarding solution.

Please feel free to browse around to learn more about my projects and their technical implementations.

## Pipeline Tools
<div class="project-entry d-flex">
  <div class="align-self-start">
    <h3 class="project-title">Pipeworks (Senior Design Thesis)<span class="badge">In Progress</span></h3>
    <p>A cloud-based suite of software that will enable small to medium sized teams to set up a pipeline to run efficient CG productions remotely. Pipeworks provides a comprehensive, out-of-the-box yet modular set of tools to support a modern creative content pipeline to streamline CG content creation. Based on four core components: Pipeworks API, Pipeworks Application Interface, Pipeworks Tool Suite, and a new UI framework, Spout UI.</p>

    <h3 class="project-title">vcontrol: A Lightweight Version Control System</h3>
    <p>Increasingly in recent years, digital artists have been using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">version control systems (VCS)</a> originally meant for software developers to manage complex non-text/binary files. In light of this trend, <i>vcontrol</i> was developed as a CLI VCS that supports a simplified and lightweight platform allowing artists to stage local versions of art assets before committing  them for review in an existing pipeline. vcontrol was built entirely using Python and packaged using PyInstaller. It supports common VCS commands including commiting, reverting, and branching for distributed version control and remote workflow support.</p>
