*Star Citizen's infamous first-person fighter experience.*

Ever since the beginning of video games and interactive media, there has always been a demand to simulate aspects of real life digitally. Increasingly in recent years, developers have been attempting to implement social constructs into online video games alongside modern physics engines to create extremely immersive environments. Such video games sometimes build a “player-driven universe,” or a world inhabited by players and run by players.

Player driven universes in online multiplayer video games are becoming highly popular, and also much more complicated. If a game is run on a player-driven universe, then the game grants players complete control over the world inside the game. Elements that were once hard coded by game mechanics, like economics and geopolitics, are now being freely moderated by players. 

Star Citizen's historical amount of crowd funding revenue has raised the brows of executives and bolstered the excitement of many gamers across the globe. However, fame cannot exist without its downsides. There is a lot of controversy attached to the game, namely surrounding Chris Roberts, Star Citizen's official leader and de facto evangelist. One of those issues surrounds Robert's ambitious ideas, which have been routinely questioned by employees of his company, Roberts Space Industry. I, too, share similar criticisms. In particular, Robert's goal of creating a "living breathing universe" both intrigues and worries me.

Before I talk about Star Citizen itself, let us first try to understand why developers would want players to drive an in-game universe to begin with. First, in-game universes make the game highly dynamic, and to some extent, always feeling fresh for players. Game mechanics are fixed, and though they may emulate dynamic content (like NPCs lowing and raising prices of game items), they are hard fixed in code. Allowing players to make decisions that impact the nature of the game allows the game to shift at the social level. Players can decide what to do, and through those decisions, influence change upon the game universe - and ultimately, other players. This is a fascinating and exciting concept in video gaming that was seen prior to the 20th century as largely unfeasible. Luckily, with the power of modern computing, such worlds have become possible to build - but to what extent can developers develop a successful player-driven universe?

When I ask that question, I am reminded of a small PC game named Face of Mankind. Ambitious in its beginnings, the original developers of the game envisioned a large-scale, futuristic universe that would be driven by its players, much like the one Robert's envisioned. Using their own decisions, players could not only control the destiny of their characters, but also the fate of the universe itself. Players had the freedom to elect their own leaders of their factions, much like early MMORPG clans. These factions could declare war and claim territory on different planets. Economics would be controlled by players, and moderators were barred from interfering with the game’s free market. In game politics were implemented, where players could send representatives, or even be representatives themselves, in a national senate. Officials could implement laws, and militaries could be formed, all with strict rules enforced by the players. 

Things that seemed otherwise impossible in other MMORPGs now seemed highly exploitable for fun. Do you want to be a mercenary and rob enemies? Feel free to do so. Do you want to become a trader who manufactured weapons and simply follows the highest bidder? Go ahead. Do you want to run for president, or even supreme dictator, and make eating pizza illegal? Don’t feel worried that you can’t. If the sound of such a world excites you, then it may also disappoint you to know that the game ultimately failed.

Why? At first glance, the reason for the games early termination may have been largely logistical. It was run by a small company, and revenue was marginal. They offered a freemium model, but not many users upgraded to premium accounts, and server maintenance costs were running high. That is, at least, the company’s reasoning for shutting down support for the game.

But what I feel ultimately failed the company was that Face of Mankind didn't deliver a completely immersive experience that the developers originally envisioned. The game promised a real, living, breathing universe, but such a dynamic world was not delivered in the end. Unfortunately, the game hinged on poor game mechanics that bogged the overall experience down. Even though it sounded great to run in game politics as a player, there was no game mechanics in place to enforce anything of substance. Players could not change the game’s penalty system, so even though taking illegal power-enhancing drugs might have been allowed by the player-run government, players were still automatically penalized by the game. Not to mention the fact that some players simply abused the system and aimed to detract fun from other players, mainly via grieving. The game ultimately drew itself towards the game’s war and combat mechanics, which was the only aspect of the game players seemed cared about. Role playing elements were thrown out the window, and everyone rejected not only the lore established by the game developers, but the need for lore to begin with. What was the point in politics when players could not control in game mechanics? Nobody seemed to care about the state of the in game world, and in the end, every treated their characters like what they were - avatars bound to the bidding of gamers. Nothing felt alive, and in the end, the game died on its own.

So now I return to Star Citizen, the promising game that attempts to achieve similar goals set about by Face of Mankind. What I fear for Star Citizen is that role playing elements cannot be sufficient enough to power fully immersive experiences - and if that cannot be achieved, then neither can the feeling of a living breathing universe. What do I mean by this? If players don’t feel like they are their characters, then players won’t treat the world they are in like a world on its own, only as what it is: a video game. But Star Citizen wants to be more than a video game - it, or at least it’s creator, wants it to be a universe.

First of all, in order to achieve the feeling of a living, breathing universe, players need to give the game world life. Because Star Citizen aims to be player driven, players need to decide on their own to make the world feel real. Game physics and graphics can only achieve so much when it comes to an immersive experience. In reality, what games like these hinge on are the players - how they interact, what the drives and motivations of players are, and how these drives and motivations impact the world around them.

I believe the developers behind Star Citizen, especially Roberts, fail to realize what is most important. They need to look at the nature of the player itself and build not a world for players to inhabit, but rather, a platform for players to build from. Players need to feel like the world is theirs, not necessarily that they are in a world designed for them. Would you not care more about a house that you drafted and built yourself, rather then a standard townhouse built by a company in the middle of suburbia? Would it not feel different to live inside this home? RPGs work the same way - they feel real when players feel like they are changing it.

Take Skyrim, for example. Though it was not a multiplayer game, Todd Howard sought to create an experience, first and foremost. He wanted players to know that the decisions they made impacted the world around them. He pushed for players to be able to pick up almost anything, despite its actual purpose. He desired the ability to analyze, and zoom into items that could be picked up, in order to appreciate the detail in every item in the world. Most of all, he wanted players to feel like they were learning on the way and at the same time discover things on their own. Players could become better at combat by practicing more, not through skill levels or by the innate ability of the character. All these aspects pulled players closer and closer to the heart of the game, a game closely linked to the story the player chose to follow and create. Players drove Skyrim, not the other way around.

The minute I heard that Star Citizen was going to have NPCs is when the first wave of disappointment hit me. Reason being, NPCs are non playable entities created by the developers to control some kind of in-game function - that's function taken away from the players. While NPCs haven’t actually been released yet, I don’t see the need for them in a game that was promised to be player driven. NPCs ruin the immersive feeling of a multiplayer universe. We, as gamers, know when something feels unreal. For example, how can you grant players the ability to capture and govern planets if those planets have NPCs inside of them? It doesn’t feel like the planet is owned at all. The NPC will most likely have no little to no reaction when its home city is taken over - it will sit there, and keep doing what it was programmed to do - and players will know this. NPCs do not feel alive.

Players are also going to be forced to choose a class and role upon the creation of their characters. Not only does this limit the direction of the players motives, but it makes players feel like they are not in a universe. Upon birth, do people choose what they will be in life? If the answer is "no," then the answer is also "no" for players starting in MMORPGs. Predefined routes detract away from the immersive experience of the player, and limits players to one route and one journey. Life is dynamic in nature - always shifting, and always changing.

Flight stabilization, realistic gravity, and state the art graphics are not enough to make players feel immersed. Immersion is a product of cleverly planned, well thought-out game mechanics that can adapt to decisions made by players. Players need to not only be in control, but feel in control. Let players conquer planets and set local laws themselves. Let them form the organizations that they want. Let players feel free and not limited by the engine - instead, let the players use the engine to guide their motives and drives. Let players makes their own decisions, and encourage them to learn about the environments around them. 

Not everything can be run by players, but the important things can - and the important things are what drives the core of a game. Stop wasting money on linguistics specialists, and instead spend it on simple, easy to program features. Give players the ability to design insignias and wear different clothing. Let players create their own organizations, governments, militaries, social structures. These changes can be simply programmed and can make things feel exponentially dynamic and real.

This is not to say that Star Citizen isn't a promising game. Recently, there have been many elements released to the public that demonstrate the game’s capability to harness immersion. The game website claims to support a near "endless number of planets," which is perfect for players setting out to create their own worlds, organizations, and governments. The flight modules are excellent from what I’ve read, and fighting feels real and exciting. The fact that characters will become wounded whenever they are shot down by enemies, and that characters only live once are fantastic, ingenious additions.

Real life can never be fully emulated in a video game, but games can serve as a medium for experience. At the very least, Star Citizen will be an excellent space flight simulator. But for it to achieve lasting success as a player driven, MMORPG, it must appreciate the demands and needs of the player, and to understand that it is the player that must bring life to its universe.
